# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

While the library is in the `0.x` series the public API may break between
minor versions. Every break is listed here with its migration.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A `link` variant on `Button`, for an action that has to weigh almost
  nothing: "forgot your password", a secondary action in a table row. No
  background and no border, but the same horizontal padding as every other
  variant, so it lines up with the buttons beside it in an actions row. Its
  focus indicator is an underline rather than the ring — the one place in the
  library where the ring is replaced instead of drawn.
- `--bb-link` and `--bb-link-active`. Accent used AS TEXT is a different role
  from the accent FILL, and the two were sharing a token: measured, the fill
  step gives 5.08:1 in light and 3.62:1 in dark, where 4.5:1 is required.
- Density tokens for the small controls — `--bb-control-box`,
  `--bb-control-box-mark`, `--bb-control-switch-height`,
  `--bb-control-switch-width` and `--bb-control-hit-area`. Checkbox, radio and
  switch were a fixed size, so compact density differed from normal by nothing
  at all.
- `--bb-focus-ring-halo-strength`, the opacity of the ring's halo, restated
  per mode. A translucent colour loses more of itself over a dark surface than
  over a light one.
- `--bb-border-control`, the border of a small control as distinct from a
  field or a panel. The same border colour does not read the same on 20px as
  on 300px.

- `TextArea`, for multi-line text. Its height comes from a row count rather
  than the control-height tokens, and it resizes vertically only.
- `NumberField`, formatted and parsed in the active locale — separators, and
  the digits themselves in some scripts. Currency comes from the config
  provider or a prop; the library never invents one.
- Two dictionary entries, `increment` and `decrement`, for the stepper
  buttons. The base composes them with the field label, so it announces
  "Increase Quantity" rather than a bare "Increase".

- `RadioGroup` and `Radio`: a set of mutually exclusive options, with a label
  for the group and one per option. The whole group is a single tab stop and
  the arrow keys move within it.
- `Switch`, for a setting that applies the moment it is flipped. It carries no
  error state and no `isRequired` on purpose — if a value needs validating
  before submission, that is a `Checkbox`.

- `Checkbox`, with an optional description and error beneath it. The base
  renders those two for a lone checkbox but does not reference them from the
  input, so the association is supplied here — a description nothing points
  at does not exist for a screen reader.

- `TextField`, the first field: label, control, description and error related
  to each other, with all eight states from the forms foundation. The library
  presents the error; deciding there is one, and writing it, stays with your
  project.
- `ConfigProvider`, carrying language, dictionary, time zone and currency.
  Nothing is detected and nothing is remembered — your application resolves
  these and passes them in. It works with no provider around it, in English
  and LTR.
- `Spinner`, with an accessible name from the dictionary. Under reduced
  motion it becomes a static ring rather than freezing part-way round.

- `Button`, the first component of the rewrite. Five variants, three sizes,
  and every state styled from React Aria's DOM state attributes.
- The token layer: layer-1 primitives baked from Radix Colors (a development
  dependency that never ships), layer-2 semantic tokens, and the three theme
  axes — mode, brand colour and density — each set by an attribute on a
  container.
- `blackborne/styles.css`: one compiled stylesheet, every class and variable
  carrying the `bb` prefix. **No global reset**, so it cannot overwrite a
  consumer's own styles, and no font is imposed.
- Two ways to theme, and they differ. Overriding a **semantic** token
  (`--bb-accent`) works anywhere, because it holds a value. Overriding the
  **brand scale** (`--bb-x-brand-9`) requires `data-bb-theme` on the same
  element — a CSS `var()` resolves where it is declared, so without the
  attribute the override silently does nothing. Documented in the package
  README and in foundation 03 §3.1.
- Public stacking tokens `--bb-layer-overlay`, `--bb-layer-popover` and
  `--bb-layer-toast`, with wide gaps so a consumer can place their own layers
  between them.

### Changed

- **The visual language settles on the Radix scales** — slate for greys,
  indigo for the brand — with radii, control heights, density spacing and a
  single focus ring tuned in the semantic layer. No component holds a value of
  its own. Fields trade a permanent heavy border for a fill, and the focus
  ring becomes a coloured border plus a halo mixed from the ring colour at the
  point of use, so an invalid field rings in danger and a branded one in the
  brand without either carrying a second rule that can drift.

- **Three tokens are now restated per mode rather than shared**, each with the
  measurement that forced it recorded beside it: `--bb-border`, `--bb-link`
  and `--bb-accent-subtle-on`. The Radix light and dark scales run in opposite
  directions, so one role — "as light as legibility allows" — lands on a
  different step in each mode.

- **`--bb-accent-subtle-on` moves from step 11 to step 12 in light.** The
  subtle family is one text colour over three backgrounds, and the pairing has
  to hold on the darkest of them: pressed measured 4.46:1 against the 4.5:1 it
  needs. Invisible until the pressed state became something the catalog could
  actually render.

- **Contrast fixes across the state colours**, found by automated
  accessibility. A filled danger button measured 3.91:1 against a 4.5:1
  requirement, and error text 3.91:1. Radix step 9 is designed for graphical
  elements, not text; the solids now use step 11 in light mode, and dark mode
  pairs step 9 with dark text — no step of the dark scales reaches 4.5:1
  against white. New `--bb-*-text` tokens for state colours used as text.

- The library is being rewritten from scratch. Nothing from `0.1.1` is carried
  over: no component, prop name, DOM structure or test id. The rewrite will
  ship as `0.2.0`.
- Repository restructured as a pnpm workspace: the package lives in
  `packages/blackborne`, the visual catalog in `apps/catalog`.

### Fixed

- Two catalog checks that were passing without checking anything. The forced
  hover, pressed and focus states never reached the DOM — the base renders its
  own state attributes on the same element and wins — so every `*-states`
  baseline had been approving six identical controls labelled as six different
  states. And the alternate brand fixture was incomplete in all five of its
  copies; a step left out falls back to the library's own indigo, so the
  stories proving the brand axis works were proving the opposite.

- The visual-regression runner no longer replaces the host's `node_modules`
  with an installation built inside the container.

### Removed

- The entire `0.1.1` codebase. It stays available under the `v0.1.1` git tag.
- `react-router-dom` as a peer dependency. The library provides no routing
  (non-goal 1).
- `react-icons` as a dependency. Icons are received, never distributed.
